and any other settings you wish to change.

```js
const settings = {
  birthday: new Date("2000-01-01T00:00:00"), // your birthday, ignore the time part
  lifeExpectancy: 80, // how many years you expect to live
  style: {
    top: "70%",
    left: 0,
    right: 0,
    bottom: 0,
    heartSize: "40px",
